# About the solution

This application provides a simple app that illustrates how a possible digital ID scheme might function.

Specifically, it examines and provides a solution to deliver decentralized invoice verification in a hypothetical hospital-insurer-claimant transaction.

It implements a public-key digital identity (DID) approach which produces non-disputable signatures that work to provide a means to prove ownership of any given artefact.
